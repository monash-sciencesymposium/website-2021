Her current research focus on the study of cancer-derived exosomes. Among a variety of cell-derived vesicles, exosomes are the nanovesicles released from various cell types into the extracellular space for intercellular communication. These vesicles were reported to serve as vehicles for intercellular transfer of genetic material (mRNA, miRNA) or proteins. Lately, these vesicles were found to play significant role in cancer development. My research interests include:To study the role of exosome in cancer progressionTo investigate the link between oncogenic mutation and exosome-mediated carcinogenesisTo explore exosome as a novel source of non-invasive cancer biomarkers given that the cancer-specific molecules were identified in the exosomes isolated from biological fluids such as urine, saliva, blood and breast milk.On the other hand, concerns about drug resistance and side effects of currently used therapeutic agents have raised interest in phytochemicals derived from dietary foods and traditional medicines which allow safe and continuing ingestion. Therefore her research also aims to discover the therapeutic use of local medicinal plant-derived phytochemicals in cancer treatment.</p> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="effect-wrapper col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 appear-animation"> <div class="zoe-effect ribbon-activator" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#speakerDetail-40"> <figure class="waves-effect waves-block waves-light" style="background-image: url(/img/people/ArkenduSen.jpg)"> <div class="overlay solid-overlay"></div> <figcaption> <div class="col-md-8 col-xs-8 text-left"> <h2 class="name">Arkendu <span>Sen</span></h2> <div class="clearfix"></div> <span class="position">JCSMHS, Monash University Malaysia</span> </div> </figcaption> <p class="bio">(Speaker, Webinar 1) Dr Arkendu Sen is Associate Professor in Clinical Anatomy at Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, an anatomist/ophthalmologist by training.

Her current research focus on the study of cancer-derived exosomes. Among a variety of cell-derived vesicles, exosomes are the nanovesicles released from various cell types into the extracellular space for intercellular communication. These vesicles were reported to serve as vehicles for intercellular transfer of genetic material (mRNA, miRNA) or proteins. Lately, these vesicles were found to play significant role in cancer development. My research interests include:<ol><li>To study the role of exosome in cancer progression</li><li>To investigate the link between oncogenic mutation and exosome-mediated carcinogenesis</li><li>To explore exosome as a novel source of non-invasive cancer biomarkers given that the cancer-specific molecules were identified in the exosomes isolated from biological fluids such as urine, saliva, blood and breast milk.</li></ol>On the other hand, concerns about drug resistance and side effects of currently used therapeutic agents have raised interest in phytochemicals derived from dietary foods and traditional medicines which allow safe and continuing ingestion. Therefore her research also aims to discover the therapeutic use of local medicinal plant-derived phytochemicals in cancer treatment.</p></p> <ul class="social"> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="modal fade text-left people-modal" id="speakerDetail-40" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="speakerDetailLabel-40" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-body"> <div class="close"> <svg class="icon icon-cross" viewBox="0 0 32 32"> <use xlink:href="/img/sprites/sprites.svg#icon-cross"></use> </svg> <div class="close-mask" data-dismiss="modal"></div> </div> <div class="people-details"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2 col-sm-2"> <div class="flow-img img-circle people-img" style="background-image: url(/img/people/ArkenduSen.jpg)"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 col-sm-10 details"> <p class="name">Arkendu Sen <span class="position">Associate Professor (JCSMHS), Academic Director (Educaiton Excellence), JCSMHS, Monash University Malaysia</span> </p> <p class="about"><p>(Speaker, Webinar 1) Dr Arkendu Sen is Associate Professor in Clinical Anatomy at Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, an anatomist/ophthalmologist by training.
